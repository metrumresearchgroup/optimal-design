# A Gentle Introduction to Optimal Design for Pharmacometric Models

This repo contains the material for the [COOPED UP webinar on optimal design](https://metrumrg.com/course/a-gentle-introduction-to-optimaldesign-for-pharmacometric-models/), given on June 8, 2020.

The slides are available as a [PDF file](slides/slides.pdf) or [in HTML](slides/slides.html), although you'll need to download or clone the repo in order to view the HTML slides.

The R code used to generate a lot of material used in the slides (along with some more narrative) is contained in [script/optimal_design.md](script/optimal_design.md).

This project makes use of [`pkgr`](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/pkgr) to install and manage the R packages.  With `pkgr` installed, simply run `pkgr install` to install the required packages.  Alternatively, if you want to install them using another method, a list of the packages used here can be found in [pkgr.yml](pkgr.yml).
