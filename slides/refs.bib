                 models are increasingly used in drug development and in
                 academic research. Hence designing efficient studies is an
                 important task. Following the first theoretical work on
                 optimal design for nonlinear mixed effect models, this
                 research theme has grown rapidly. There are now several
                 different software tools that implement an evaluation of the
                 Fisher information matrix for population PKPD. We compared and
                 evaluated five software tools: PFIM, PkStaMP, PopDes, PopED,
                 and POPT. The comparisons were performed using two models: i)
                 a simple one compartment warfarin PK model; ii) a more complex
                 PKPD model for Pegylated-interferon (peg-interferon) with both
                 concentration and response of viral load of hepatitis C virus
                 (HCV) data. The results of the software were compared in terms
                 of the standard error values of the parameters (SE) predicted
                 from the software and the empirical SE values obtained via
                 replicated clinical trial simulation and estimation. For the
                 warfarin PK model and the peg-interferon PKPD model all
                 software gave similar results. Of interest it was seen, for
                 all software, that the simpler approximation to the Fisher
                 information matrix, using the block diagonal matrix, provided
                 predicted SE values that were closer to the empirical SE
                 values than when the more complicated approximation was used
                 (the full matrix). For most PKPD models, using any of the
                 available software tools will provide meaningful results,
                 avoiding cumbersome simulation and allowing design
                 optimisation.",

                 advances into an easily useable enhanced GUI. Furthermore, we

                 experiments such as: faster and more robust FIM calculations
                 and optimizations, optimizing over cost/utility functions and
                 diagnostic tools and plots to evaluate design performance.
